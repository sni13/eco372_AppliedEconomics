# ECO372 Applied Regression Analysis and Empirical Papers

## Assignment 1: Burden & Linden (2013)
In the exercise, you are to re-analyze some of the findings of the 2013 paper by Dana Burde and Leigh L. Linden about
schooling in Afghanistan.1 The study took place in rural Afghanistan, and tries to find the effect of placing a school in a
village, on academic participation and performance among all children.


## Assignment 2: LaLonde (1986) 
This exercise uses data from LaLonde (1986), who examined the results of the
National Supported Work Demonstration (NSW), a temporary employment program in the US, designed to help
disadvantaged workers lacking basic job skills move into the labour market by giving them work experience and
counselling in a sheltered environment.1 Unlike other federally sponsored employment and training programs at the
time, the NSW program assigned qualified applicants to training positions randomly. We are considering here NSW
male participants only.

## Assignment 3: Angrist et al. (2002)
In the mid-90s, Colombia distributed vouchers which partially covered the cost of private secondary school for students who maintained
satisfactory academic progress. Because of oversubscription to the programme, the allocation of vouchers was randomized using
lotteries. Lottery winners received the voucher, while lottery losers did not. In their 2002 article,1 Joshua Angrist and co-authors
examine the effect of these vouchers on several educational outcomes.

## Assignment 4: Agan & Starr (2018)
This exercise uses data from the Agar & Starr (2018) paper, who examined the results of a policy to ban employers from asking
Criminal record information to job applicants. The paper demonstrates that in New Jersey and New York City, the policy increased the
racial gap in call back between (fictitious) Black and White applicants.
